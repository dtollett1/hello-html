      As a family we have started to tinker with a small freshwater tank with a
      few snails and an angelfish. this new venture has sparked my curiosity,
      and drawn me to the complexity and beauty of saltwater reef tanks. While
      shopping for supplies for our freshwater tank I was instantly drawn to the
      elaborate and beautiful saltwater tanks with coral, Anemone and various
      other marine life.

      Growing up, my grandmother owned a small hotel on the Gulf of Mexico in
      SWFL. Many summer days were spent swimming, snorkeling and interacting
      with the marine life right outside her back door.

      Watching the reef tanks reminded me of my childhood and has inspired me to
      begin the endless amount of research (and money) it takes to build and
      sustain one of these incredible tanks.
